### Redux Usage

This app uses **Redux Toolkit** for managing the state of students in a centralized store. The studentSlice handles adding, removing, and editing students using reducers. The state is accessed using useSelector, and updates are triggered with useDispatch. LocalStorage is used to persist state between reloads.
